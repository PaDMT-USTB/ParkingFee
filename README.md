2.  Output specifications

   Call the parking fee interface of the program to get the double output parameter fee. The output result is divided into three situations according to the input:

   (a) The user provides coupons: When the user provides coupons, they can enjoy a 50% discount on the original parking fee.

   (b) The user chooses the estimated parking time: The user can choose the estimated parking time according to his situation, divided into three time periods, "no more than 2 hours", "2 hours to 4 hours" and "4 hours to 24 hours". If the parking time is within the estimated time, the driver can enjoy a 40% discount. On the contrary, the driver needs to pay an additional 20% additional management fee in addition to the original parking fee.

   (c) The user has neither coupons nor estimated parking time: If the driver does not provide coupons or estimated parking time, the parking fee will not be discounted.

     It should be noted that the user cannot give the estimated parking time while providing the coupon, and can only choose one preferential method or neither.

     When the input meets the program specifications, the final parking fee is calculated according to the parking time, whether to enjoy a discount and the parking unit price. The calculation method of the parking unit price is shown in the table.
